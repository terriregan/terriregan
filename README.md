## Terri Regan | Portfolio

Personal portfolio site developed to provide a space to showcase work, connect with others and experiment with technologies. Built with a responsive layout, it takes a mobile first approach that uses progressive enhancement to ensure that older browsers still provide a solid experience, whilst modern browsers can go the next step and enhance the time spent on the site. 

All code is mine.
